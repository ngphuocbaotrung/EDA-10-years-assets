# EDA: 10-Year Asset Investment Analysis
Instead of drinking a can of Coca-Cola per day, what we can get after 10 years investing in different kinds of assets as below

This project explores the historical performance of different asset classes over the past 10 years, including:

- **Bitcoin**
- **Gold**
- **ETF**
- **Stock**
- **Savings (5% annual interest)**

The analysis simulates investing **1€ per day** into each asset starting from 2015, and visualises the investment value growth using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
